This is the initial submission of escalatoR to CRAN.

### Package Description
escalatoR provides comprehensive tools for Department of Defense (DoD) cost escalation analysis following Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) methodology. The package includes functions for retrieving economic data, calculating escalation rates, generating forecasts, and creating weighted indices for complex acquisition portfolios. It also features an interactive Shiny application for guided analysis workflows.

### Testing
The package has been tested on:
- Windows 10/11 (R 4.3.0, R 4.3.1, R-devel)
- macOS (R 4.3.0)
- Ubuntu 20.04 (R 4.3.0)

### R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

### Dependencies
All dependencies are available on CRAN. The package uses:
- Core: tidyverse ecosystem, shiny
- Data: fredr (for Federal Reserve Economic Data API)
- Analysis: forecast, tseries
- Export: openxlsx
- All minimum version requirements are conservative and tested

### Documentation
- All exported functions are documented with examples
- Comprehensive vignettes provided
- NEWS.md documents all changes
- README.md provides clear installation and usage instructions

### API Usage
The package uses the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API through the fredr package. API access requires a free API key from the Federal Reserve. All API calls respect rate limits and include appropriate error handling.

### Interactive Features
The package includes a Shiny application launched via launch_escalator_app(). This is optional functionality and the core package functions work independently.

### Target Audience
This package is designed for DoD cost estimators, defense contractors, and analysts working with defense acquisition cost modeling. The methodology follows official DoD Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) standards.

### Previous Submissions
This is the first submission of this package to CRAN.

### Notes for CRAN Maintainers
- Package name "escalatoR" follows R naming conventions (escalator + R)
- All examples are executable and demonstrate package functionality
- No write operations to user directories (uses tempdir() when needed)
- All external API calls are conditional and handle connection failures gracefully
- Shiny app launches only when explicitly called by user
